## Soccer League Predictor
#### SMU AA Project - Implementing Multi-threading in a Java application
This application simulates a full soccer league season and prints out the outcome. Currently is running on a single thread.

#### How to use

##### Unix
execute `./run.sh` in project root directory (Might need to add executable permission)

##### Windows
execute `./run.bat` in project root directory. I have not tested this yet!

#### WIP
- Multi-threading
- Code refactor
- Web UI?
